## Background
As a student at UCSD who are looking for housing, finding a roommate can be a challenging and time-consuming process for individuals seeking compatible living arrangements. It is difficult to find a roommate who aligns with personal preferences, lifestyle, and habits. The Roomies web app aims to simplify the roommate search process by providing a platform for users to find compatible roommates based on their preferences and lifestyle. The web app will help users find roommates who share similar interests, habits, and budgets.

This project was developed by Mingyang Liu, Jiangnan Xu, Brittany Trieu, Aditya Barsainya, and Aidan Denlinger [as a final project for CSE 210, taught by Michael Coblenz in Winter 2023](https://mcoblenz.github.io/CSE210/).

## Documentation
See the project documentation in our [Github Wiki](https://github.com/CSE210-G13/my-roommates/wiki).

## Issue Tracking
See our sprints and issue tracking in our [Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/CSE210-G13/projects/1).

## Generic Next.js Readme
This is the generic readme that came with our Next.js project. Note that our documentaton has information on how to get started on the project, but we're leaving this here as a resource.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
